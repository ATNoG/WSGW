# WebSocket Gateway (WSGW)

WebSocket (WS) Gateway.

Rather simple pub/sub gateway that bridges UDP and WebSockets (WS).
Producers share data through a UDP/WS connection, it only supports JSON data.
Clients request data through a ws/upd connection.

It has been used to show case small IoT scenarios in school demonstrations.

## Prerequisites

Most of my code requires a library named [utils](https://github.com/mariolpantunes/utils).
This library is no exception, it also requires Jetty libraries (from WS support).
Currently, it requires Java 8.
In the future the code will be converted to Java 9 and the Jetty requirement will be dropped.

## Installation

The whole project was done in Maven, as such to package the application just run:
```
mvn package
```

To execute the application just run:
```
java -Djava.util.logging.config.file=logging.properties -jar target/wsgw-1.0.jar wsgw.properties 
```
or (without the suggested logger configuration)
```
java -jar target/wsgw-1.0.jar wsgw.properties 
```

## Samples and Examples

We provide examples of two webpages that subscribe data from sensors (DTH22 and BME280),
and the ESP8266 (arduino sketch) code to publish the data.
The code can be found in samples folder: arduino and webpages respectively.
